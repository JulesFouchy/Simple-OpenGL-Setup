# Simple-OpenGL-Setup

Welcome to this barebone OpenGL project !

It is meant for you to copy-paste and use as a starting point for your own projects.

(NB : if you are not planning on learning how to make a computer graphics application from scratch, you should consider using a more fully-featured framework like [Cool](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Cool)).

## Compiling

You need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

To use CMake I recommend this VS Code extension : [ms-vscode.cmake-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools). You will need to setup the extension with a compiler. Here is [the tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux). It is based on Linux but at the bottom of the page you will find the explanations to adapt it for [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) and [Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac).

Alternatively, you can just create a *build* folder at the root of this project, open a terminal and run `cmake ..` ; chances are it will detect what compiler you have installed and generate the appropriate Makefile / Visual Studio solution / Xcode project.


## main.cpp

In here we initialize [*glfw*](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/) (the library that handles the window and user inputs), create a window and then start the app. You don't really need to modify this file, except to change your window name or initial size.

## App

This is the actual root of your project. This is where your drawing code should go, as well as handling inputs from the user.

## User inputs

To learn more about the parameters you receive in the callbacks, read [glfw's documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html).

## assets

The *assets* folder will be copied to the folder where your executable is created. You can put all the assets that your project needs in there, like textures, shaders, 3D models *etc.*
